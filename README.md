# 📚 Library Management System

A streamlined library management application built with Streamlit and Python, implementing various data structures including linked lists, stacks, and binary search trees.

## 🌟 Features

- **Book Management**: Add, view, and remove books from the library collection
- **Borrowing System**: Track book loans and returns with timestamps
- **Search Functionality**: Quickly find books using binary search tree implementation
- **Alphabetical Sorting**: View all books in alphabetical order
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, intuitive UI with Streamlit
- **Transaction History**: Complete log of all borrowing and return activities

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework for the user interface
- **Custom Data Structures**:
  - Linked Lists for book collection management
  - Stack for tracking borrowing history
  - Binary Search Tree for efficient book searching and alphabetical sorting
